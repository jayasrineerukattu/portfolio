## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Jaya sree, a web development and UI/UX enthusiast currently exploring front-end design, mobile app development, and IoT. I love working on creative projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer.

Outside of tech, I'm a classical dancer, an avid chess player, and a fan of Netflix dramas and Telugu movies. I'm always excited to learn something new and collaborate on meaningful projects.
